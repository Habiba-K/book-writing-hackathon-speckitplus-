# Gazebo Fundamentals

This section covers the fundamentals of Gazebo simulation for digital twin development.

## Installation

First, set up your Gazebo environment by following the [installation guide](./installation-guide.md).

## Tutorial

Once installed, proceed to the [Gazebo Simulation Setup Tutorial](./tutorial.md) to learn how to create your first digital twin simulation.

## Key Concepts

Gazebo provides a physics-based simulation environment that enables:
- Realistic robot modeling and simulation
- Sensor simulation with realistic noise models
- Physics simulation with accurate collision detection
- Integration with ROS 2 for robot control

Continue to the next section to learn about configuring physics simulation properties.
